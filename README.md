# JSON-image-scraper
A python script to download all images from a json file. Couldn't find one online already, although i'm not very good at looking.

Paste this in terminal <i>(python if not using python3)</i>
> python3 download_images.py path/to/your/file.json

Reads your JSON file

Finds all URLs in it (anywhere in the JSON structure)

Downloads them to a folder called downloaded_images
